get sources from the Fritz marshal, 
run custom analysis on each, 
assign some values and post them back to Fritz
as Annotations on those sources

INSTRUCTIONS:
    You must create a "config.yaml" file and specify the functions you want to 
    run on each source, as im the example given below. 
    You must also create a file named "token" and copy your token from Fritz 
    into this file. 
    Both config.yaml and token should be ignored by git, so you can custumize 
    and put your token in there without it being published.
